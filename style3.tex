\section{\faBank~ About NCOCS-2020}
The idea behind NCOCS is to promote research \& development in the field of communication engineering and technology in India. The aim of this conference is to bring academicians, researchers, startups, and industrial practitioners together to exchange their ideas in the area of communications. The $1^{st}$ edition of NCOCS began in September 2019. It was a grand success with positive feedback from the participants. With an overwhelming response, the organizing team is going to make a second milestone of the NCOCS, in November 2020. With great support, the team is going to connect globally for exchanging the ideas in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence for communication systems. 
Keeping in view of the unprecedented pandemic situation created due to COVID-19, the competent authority had decided to conduct the $2^{nd}$ edition of NCOCS in virtual mode. 
%Therefore, participants are required to equip with Laptop/PC/Mobile having internet connectivity. The registered participants will receive further details regarding the online platform and login credentials via e-mail.
